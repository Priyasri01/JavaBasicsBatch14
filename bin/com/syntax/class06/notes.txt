recap

Logical AND && -- All condition must be true
logical or || - at least 1condition must be true or 

compiler always check our code before giving it it's default values:

int =0;
double=0.0;
boolean = false;
String and other non primitive =null;

compiler compiles source into binary

===============================================================

" if statment" 
 if statment is condition based.
  so it execute block of code until it find the match.
 
=====================================================
switch case is value based.it will check only  the equality 
it knows the value-> jump into matching case 
it's faster
no duplicated case in switch 
limitation for switch case
switch case cannot logical operator like &&,||, !=
switch case can not do relational operators like <,>, ==, !=
Switch cannot work with boolean values
switch cannot work with float/double & long data type
switch syntax

switch(varibale){

}
