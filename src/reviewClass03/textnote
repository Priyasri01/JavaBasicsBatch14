logical operators:
	logical operators helps us test more than one conditions. In Java we have && as the And Operator and || or operator and ! not.
why we should learn logical operators?
	logical operators help us reduce the number if-condition that we write in certain case.
	
what is the syntax?
		if(condition1 && condition2){
		sout "hello"; 
		
		}
		
		if(condtion1){
			if(condition2){
			 sout "Hello";
			}
		}
		
	both above syntax will give same out , only thing the first thing we && logical operator and second one we made a nested if.
